 [ /* Title: The Social Secretary Author: David Graham Phillips Chapter 1 */
 [`November 29. At half-past one to-day--half-past one exactly--I began my "career."
 Mrs. Carteret said she would call for me at five minutes to one. But it was ten minutes after when she appeared, away down at the corner of I Street. Jim was walking up and down the drawing-room; I was at the window, watching that corner of I Street. "There she blows!" I cried,
 my voice brave, but my heart like a big lump of something soggy and sad.
 Jim hurried up and stood behind me, staring glumly over my shoulder. He has proposed to me in so many words more than twenty times in the last three years, and has looked it every time we've met--we meet almost every day. I could feel that he was getting ready to propose again, but I hadn't the slightest fear that he'd touch me. He's in the army, and his "pull" has kept him snug and safe at Washington and has promoted him steadily until now he's a Colonel at thirty-five. But he was brought up in a formal, old-fashioned way, and he'd think it a deadly insult to a woman he respected enough to ask her to be his wife if he should touch her without her permission. I admire Jim's self-restraint,
 but--I couldn't bear being married to a man who worshiped me, even if I only liked him. If I loved him, I'd be utterly miserable. I've been trying hard to love Jim for the past four months, or ever since I've really realized how desperate my affairs are. But I can't. And the most exasperating part of my obstinacy is that I can't find a good reason or excuse for it.
 As I was saying--or, rather, writing--Jim stood behind me and said in a husky sort of voice: "You ain't goin' to do it, are you, Gus?"
 I didn't answer. If I had said anything, it would have been a feeble,
 miserable "No"--which would have meant that I was accepting the alternative--him. All my courage had gone and I felt contemptibly feminine and dependent.
 I looked at him--I did like the expression of his eyes and the strength and manliness of him from head to foot. What a fine sort of man a "pull" and a private income have spoiled in Jim Lafollette! He went on:
 "Surely, I'm not more repellent to you than--than what that auto is coming to take you away to."
 "Shame on you, Jim Lafollette!" I said angrily--most of the anger so that he wouldn't understand and take advantage of the tears in my eyes and voice. "But how like you! How _brave_!"
 He reddened at that--partly because he felt guilty toward me, partly because he is ashamed of the laziness that has made him shirk for thirteen years. "I don't care a hang whether it's brave or not, or _what_ it is," he said sullenly. "I want _you_. And it seems to me I've got to do something--use force, if necessary--to keep you from--_from that_. You ain't fit for it, Gus--not in any way. Why, it's worse than being a servant. And you--brought up as you've been--"
 I laughed--a pretty successful effort. "I've been educating for it all my life, without knowing it. And it's honest and independent. If you had the right sort of ideas of self-respect, you'd be ashamed of me if you thought I'd be low enough to marry a man I couldn't give my heart to--for a living."
 "Don't talk rubbish," he retorted. "Thousands of women do it. Besides,
 if I don't mind, why should you? God knows you've made it plain enough that you don't love me. Gus, why can't you marry me and let me save you from this just as a brother might save a sister?"
 "Because I may love somebody some day, Jim," said I. I wanted to hurt him--for his own sake, and also because I didn't want him to tempt me.
 The auto was at the curb. He didn't move until I was almost at the drawing-room door. Then he rushed at me and his look frightened me a little. He caught me by the arm. "It's the last chance, Augusta!" he exclaimed. "Won't you?"
 I drew away and hurried out. "Then you don't intend to have anything to do with me after I've crossed the line and become a toiler?" I called back over my shoulder. I couldn't resist the temptation to be thoroughly feminine and leave the matter open by putting him in the wrong with my "woman's last word." I was so low in my mind that I reasoned that my adventure might be as appalling as I feared, in which case it would be well to have an alternative. I wonder if the awful thoughts we sometimes have are our real selves or if they just give us the chance to measure the gap between what we might be as shown by them and what we are as shown by our acts. I hope the latter, for surely I can't be as poor a creature as I so often have impulses to make myself.
 Mrs. Carteret was waiting for the servant to open the door. I hurried her back toward the auto, being a little afraid that Jim would be desperate enough to come out and beg her to help him--and I knew she would do it if she were asked. In the first place, Jessie always does what she's asked to do--if it helps her to spend time and breath. In the second place, she'd never let up on me if she thought I had so good a chance to marry. For she knows that Washington is the hardest place in the world for a woman to find a husband unless she's got something that appeals to the ambition of men. Besides, she thinks, as do many of my friends, that I am indifferent to men and discourage them. As if any woman was indifferent to men! The only point is that women's ideas of what constitutes a man differ, and my six years in this cosmopolis have made me somewhat discriminating.`], [
 `But to return to Jessie, she was full of apologies for being late.
 "I've thought of nothing but you, dear, for two days and nights. And I thought that for once in my life I'd be on time. Yet here I am, fifteen minutes late, unless that clock's wrong." She was looking at the beautiful little clock set in the dashboard of the auto.
 "Only fifteen minutes!" I said. "And you never before were known to be less than half an hour late. You even kept the President waiting twenty minutes."
 "Isn't it stupid, this fussing about being on time?" she replied. "I don't believe any but dull people and those who want to get something from one are ever on time. For those who really live, life is so full that punctuality is impossible. But I should have been on time, if I hadn't been down seeing the Secretary of War about Willie Catesby--poor Willie! He has been _so_ handicapped by nature!"
 "Did you get it for him?" I asked.
 "I think so--third secretary at St. Petersburg. The secretary said:
 'But Willie is almost an imbecile, Mrs. Carteret. If we don't send him abroad, his family'll have to put him away.' And I said: 'That's true, Mr. Secretary. But if we don't send that sort of people to foreign courts, how are we to repay the insults they send us in the form of imbecile attachés?' And then I handed him six letters from senators--every one of them a man whose vote he needs for his fight on that nomination. They were _real_ letters. So presently he said,
 'Very well, Mrs. Carteret, I'll do what I can to resent the Czar's last insult by exporting Willie to him."
 I waited a moment, then burst out with what I was full of. "You think she'll take me?" I said.
 Jessie reproached me with tragedy in her always intensely serious gray eyes. "Take _you_?" she exclaimed. "Take a Talltowers when there's a chance to get one? Why, as soon as I explained who you were, she fairly quivered with eagerness."
 "You had to _explain_ who a Talltowers is?" I said with mock amazement. It's delightful to poke fun at Jessie; she always appreciates a jest by taking it more seriously than an ordinary statement of fact.
 "But, dear, you mustn't be offended. You know Mrs. Burke is very common and ignorant. She doesn't know the first thing about the world. She said to me the other day that she had often heard there were such things as class distinctions, but had never believed it until she came to Washington--she had thought it was like the fairy stories. She never was farther east than Chicago until this fall. She went there to the Fair. You must get her to tell you how she and three other women who belong to the same Chautauqua Circle went on together and slept in the same room and walked from dawn till dark every day, catalogue in hand,
 for eleven days. It's too pathetic. She said, 'My! but my feet were sore. I thought I was a cripple for life.'"
 "That sounds nice and friendly," said I, suspicious that Jessie's quaint sense of humor had not permitted her to appreciate Mrs. Burke.
 "I'm so dreadfully afraid I'll fall into the clutches of people that'll try to--to humiliate me."
 Tears sprang to Jessie's eyes. "Please don't, Gus!" she pleaded.
 "They'll be only too deferential. And you must keep them so. I suspect that Mrs. Burke chums with her servants."
 We were stopping before the house--the big, splendid Ralston Castle,
 as they call it; one of the very finest of the houses that have been building since rich men began to buy into the Senate and Cabinet and aspire for diplomatic places, and so have attracted other rich families to Washington. What a changed Washington it is, and what a fight the old simplicity is making against the new ostentation! The sight of the Ralston Castle in my present circumstances depressed me horribly. I went to my second ball there, and it was given for me by Mrs. Ralston. And only a little more than a year ago I danced in the quadrille of honor with the French Ambassador--and the next week the Ralstons went smash and hurried abroad to hide, all except the old man who is hanging round Wall Street, they say, trying to get on his feet with the aid of his friends. Friends! How that word must burn into him every time he thinks of it. When he got into a tight place his "friends" took advantage of their knowledge of his affairs to grab his best securities, they say. No doubt he was disagreeable in a way, but still those who turned on him the most savagely had been intimate with him and had accepted his hospitality.
 "You'll be mistress here," Jessie was saying. She had put on her prophetic look and pose--she really believes she has second sight at certain times. "And you'll marry the son, if you manage it right. I counted him in when I was going over the advantages and disadvantages of the place before proposing it to you. He looks like a mild, nice young man--though I must say I don't fancy cowlicks right in the part of the hair. I saw only his picture."
 A tall footman with an insolent face opened the door and ushered us into the small drawing-room to the left: "Mrs. Carteret! Miss Talltowers!" he shouted--far louder than is customary or courteous. I saw the impudent grin in his eyes--no proper man-servant ever permits any one to see his eyes. And he almost dropped the curtain in our faces, in such haste was he to get back to his lounging-place below stairs.`],[
 `His roar had lifted to her feet an elderly woman with her hair so badly dyed that it made her features look haggard and harsh and even dissipated. She made a nervous bow. She was of the figure called stout by the charitable and sumptuous by the crude. She was richly-dressed,
 over-dressed, dressed-up--shiny figured satin with a great deal of beads and lace that added to her width and subtracted from her height.
 She stood miserable, jammed and crammed into a tight corset. Her hands--very nice hands, I noticed--were folded upon her stomach. As soon as I got used to that revolting hair-dye, I saw that she had in fact a large-featured, sweet face with fine brown eyes. Even with the dye she was the kind of looking woman that it sounds perfectly natural to hear her husband call "mother."
 Jessie went up to her as she stood wretched in her pitiful attempt at youth and her grandeur of clothes and surroundings. Mrs. Burke looked down kindly, with a sudden quizzical smile that reminded me of my suspicions as to the Chicago Fair story. Jessie was looking up like a plump, pretty, tame robin, head on one side. "_Dear_ Mrs. Burke," she said. "This is Miss Talltowers, and I'm sure you'll love each other."
 Mrs. Burke looked at me--I thought, with a determined attempt to be suspicious and cautious. I'm afraid Jessie's reputation for tireless effort to do something for everybody has finally "queered" her recommendations. However, whatever warning Mrs. Burke had received went for nothing. She was no match for Jessie--Jessie from whom his Majesty at the White House hides when he knows she's coming for an impossible favor--she was no match for Jessie and she knew it. She wiped the sweat from her face and stammered: "I hope we'll suit each other, Miss--" In her embarrassment she had forgotten my name.
 "Talltowers," whispered Jessie with a side-splitting look of tragic apology to me. Just then the clock in the corner struck out the half-hour from its cathedral bell--the sound echoed and reëchoed through me, for it marked the beginning of my "career." Jessie went on more loudly: "And now that our _business_ is settled, can't we have some lunch, Mrs. Burke? I'm starved."
 Mrs. Burke brightened. "The Senator won't be here to-day," she drawled,
 in a tone which always suggests to me that, after all, life is a smooth, leisurely matter with plenty of time for everything except work. "As he was leaving for the Capitol this morning, he says to me,
 says he: 'You women had better fight it out alone.'"
 "The _dear_ Senator!" said Jessie. "He's _so_ clever?"
 "Yes, he _is_ mighty clever with those he likes," replied Mrs.
 Burke--Jessie looking at me to make sure I would note Mrs. Burke's "provincial" way of using the word clever.
 Jessie saved the luncheon--or, at least, thought she was saving it.
 Mrs. Burke and I had only to listen and eat. I caught her looking at me several times, and then I saw shrewdness in her eyes--good-natured,
 but none the less penetrating for that. And I knew I should like her,
 and should get on with her. At last our eyes met and we both smiled.
 After that she somehow seemed less crowded and foreign in her tight,
 fine clothes. I saw she was impatient for Jessie to go the moment luncheon was over, but it was nearly three o'clock before we were left alone together. There fell an embarrassed silence--for both of us were painfully conscious that nothing had really been settled.
 "When do you wish me to come--if you do wish it at all?" I asked, by way of making a beginning.
 "When do you think you could come?" she inquired nervously.
 "Then you do wish to give me a trial? I hope you won't feel that Mrs.
 Carteret's precipitate way binds you."
 She gave me a shrewd, good-natured look. "I want you to come," she said. "I wanted it from what I'd heard of you--I and Mr. Burke. I want it more than ever, now that I've seen you. When can you come?"
 "To-morrow--to-morrow morning?"
 "Come as early as you like. The salary is--is satisfactory?"
 "Mrs. Carteret said--but I'm sure--you can judge better--whatever--" I stuttered, red as fire.
 Mrs. Burke laughed. "I can see you ain't a great hand at business. The salary is two thousand a year, with a three months' vacation in the time we're not at Washington. Always have a plain understanding in money matters--it saves a lot of mean feelings and quarrels."
 "Very well--whatever you think. I don't believe I'm worth much of anything until I've had a chance to show what I can do."
 "Well, Tom--Mr. Burke--said two thousand would be about right at the set-off," she drawled in her calming tone. "So we'll consider that settled."
 "Yes," I gasped, with a big sigh of relief. "I suppose you wish me to take charge of your social matters--relieve you of the burdensome part of entertaining?"
 "I just wish you could," she said, with a great deal of humor in her slow voice. "But I've got to keep that--it's the trying to make people have a good time and not look and act as if they were wondering why they'd come."`],[
 `"That'll soon wear off," said I. "Most of the stiffness is strangeness on both sides, don't you think?"
 "I don't know. As nearly as I can make out, they never had a real,
 natural good time in their lives. They wear the Sunday, go-to-meeting clothes and manners the whole seven days. I'll never get used to it.
 I can't talk that kind of talk. And if I was just plain and natural,
 they'd think I was stark crazy."
 "Did you ever try?"
 She lifted her hands in mock-horror. "Mercy, no! Tom--Mr. Burke--warned me."
 I laughed. "Men don't know much about that sort of thing," said I. "A woman might as well let a man tell her how to dress as how to act."
 She colored. "He does," she said, her eyes twinkling. "He was here two winters--this is my first. I've a kind of feeling that he really don't know, but he's positive and--I've had nobody else to talk about it with. I'm a stranger here--not a friend except people who--well, I can guess pretty close to what they say behind my back." She laughed--a great shaking of as much of her as was not held rigid by that tight corset. "Not that I care--I like a joke myself, and I'm a good deal of a joke among these grand folks. Only, I do want to help Tom, and not be a drag." She gave me a sudden, sharp look. "I don't know why I trust you, I'm sure."
 "Because I'm your confidential adviser," said I, "and it's always well to keep nothing from a confidential adviser." The longer I looked and listened, the larger possibilities I saw in her. My enthusiasm was rising.
 She rose and came to me and kissed me. There were tears in her eyes.
 "I've been _so_ lonesome," she said. "Even Tom don't seem natural any more, away off here in the East. Sometimes I get so homesick that I just can't eat or anything."
 "We're going to have a lot of fun," said I encouragingly--as if she were twenty-four and I fifty, instead of it being the other way.
 "You'll soon learn the ropes."
 "I'm so glad you use slang," she drawled, back in her chair and comfortably settled. "My, but Tom'll be scandalized. He's made inquiries about you and has made up his mind that whatever you say is right. And I almost believed he knew the trails. I might 'a' known!
 He's a man, you see, and always was stiff with the ladies. You ought to 'a' seen the letter he wrote proposing to me. You see, I'm kind of fat and always was. Mother used to tease me because I hadn't any beaux except Tom, who wouldn't come to the point. She said: 'Lizzie, you'll never have a man make real love to you.' And she was right. When Tom proposed he wrote very formal-like--not a sentimental word. And when we were married and got better acquainted, I teased him about it, and tried to get him to make love, real book kind of love. But not a word!
 But he's fond of me--we always have got on fine, and his being no good at love-talk is just one of our jokes."
 It was fine to hear her drawl it out--I knew that she was sure to make a hit, if only I could get her under way, could convince her that it's nice to be natural if you're naturally nice.
 "Tom" came in from the Senate and I soon saw that, though she was a "really" lady, of the only kind that is real--the kind that's born right, he was a made gentleman, and not a very successful job. He was small and thin and dressed with the same absurd stiff care with which he had made her dress. He had a pointed reddish beard and reddish curls, and he used a kind of scent that smelt cheap though it probably wasn't. He was very precise and distant with me--how "Lizzie's" eyes did twinkle as she watched him. I saw that she was "on to" Tom with the quickness with which a shrewd woman always finds out, once she gets the clue.
 "Have you had Miss Talltowers shown her rooms, Mrs. Burke?" he soon inquired.
 "Why, no, pa," replied Mrs. Burke. "I forgot it clear." As she said "pa" he winced and her eyes danced with fun. She went on to me: "You don't mind our calling each other pa and ma before you, do you, Miss Talltowers? We're so used to doing it that, if you minded it and we had to stop, we'd feel as if we had company in the house all the time."
 I didn't dare answer, I was so full of laughter. For "pa" looked as if he were about to sink through the floor. She led me up to my rooms--a beautiful suite on the third floor. "We took the house furnished," she explained as we went, "and I feel as if I was living in a hotel--except that the servants ain't nearly so nice. I do hope you'll help me with them. Tom wanted me to take a housekeeper, but those that applied were such grand ladies that I'd rather 'a' done all my own work than 'a'
 had any one of them about. Perhaps we could get one now, and you could kind of keep her in check."
 "I think it'd be better to have some one," I replied. "I've had some experience in managing a house." I couldn't help saying it unsteadily--not because I miss our house; no, I'm sure it wasn't that.
 But I suddenly saw the old library and my father looking up from his book to smile lovingly at me as I struggled with the household accounts. Anyhow, deep down I'm glad he did know so little about business and so much about everything that's fine. I'd rather have my memories of him than any money he could have left me by being less of a father and friend and more of a "practical" man.
 Mrs. Burke looked at me sympathetically--I could see that she longed to say something about my changed fortunes, but refrained through fear of not saying the right thing. I must teach her never to be afraid of that--a born lady with a good heart could never be really tactless.
 She went to the front door with me, opening it for me herself to the contemptuous amusement of the tall footman. We shook hands and kissed--I usually can't bear to have a woman kiss me, but I'd have felt badly if "ma" Burke hadn't done it.
 When I got back to Rachel's and burst into the drawing-room with a radiant face, I heard a grunt like a groan. It was from Jim in the twilight near Rachel at the tea-table. "I'm going out to service to-morrow," said I to Rachel. "So you're to be rid of your visitor at last."
 "Oh, Gus!" exclaimed Rachel between anger and tears. And Jim looked black and sullen. But I was happy--and am to-night. Happy for the first time in two years. I'm going to _do_ something--and it is something that interests me. I'm going to launch a fine stately ship, a full-rigged four-master in this big-little sea of Washington society.
 What a sensation I can make with it among the pretty holiday boats!

 [ /* Title: Mr. Rabbit's Wedding Author: Albert Bigelow Paine Chapter 1*/
 [`THE Little Lady has been poring over a first reader, because she has started to school now, and there are lessons almost every evening. Then by and by she closes the book and comes over to where the Story Teller is looking into the big open fire.
 The Little Lady looks into the fire, too, and thinks. Then pretty soon she climbs into the Story Teller's lap and leans back, and looks into the fire and thinks some more.
 "Did the Hollow Tree people ever go to school?" she says. "I s'pose they did, though, or they wouldn't know how to read and write, and send invitations and things."
 The Story Teller knocks the ashes out of his pipe and lays it on the little stand beside him.
 "Why, yes indeed, they went to school," he says. "Didn't I ever tell you about that?"
 "You couldn't have," says the Little Lady, "because I never thought about its happening, myself, until just now."
 "Well, then," says the Story Teller, "I'll tell you something that Mr.
 Jack Rabbit told about, one night in the Hollow Tree, when he had been having supper with the 'Coon and 'Possum and the Old Black Crow, and they were all sitting before the fire, just as we are sitting now. It isn't really much about school, but it shows that Jack Rabbit went to one, and explains something else, too."`],[
 `Mr. Crow had cooked all his best things that evening, and everything had tasted even better than usual. Mr. 'Possum said he didn't really feel as if he could move from his chair when supper was over, but that he wanted to do the right thing, and would watch the fire and poke it while the others were clearing the table, so that it would be nice and bright for them when they were ready to enjoy it. So then the Crow and the 'Coon and Jack Rabbit flew about and did up the work, while Mr. 'Possum put on a fresh stick, then lit his pipe, and leaned back and stretched out his feet, and said it surely was nice to have a fine, cozy home like theirs,
 and that he was always happy when he was doing things for people who appreciated it, like those present.
 Mr. Rabbit said he certainly did appreciate being invited to the Hollow Tree, living, as he did, alone, an old bachelor, with nobody to share his home; and then pretty soon the work was all done up, and Jack Rabbit and the others drew up their chairs, too, and lit their pipes, and for a while nobody said anything, but just smoked and felt happy.
 Mr. 'Possum was first to say something. He leaned over and knocked the ashes out of his pipe, then leaned back and crossed his feet, and said he'd been thinking about Mr. Rabbit's lonely life, and wondering why it was that, with his fondness for society and such a good home, he had stayed a bachelor so long. Then the Crow and the 'Coon said so, too, and asked Jack Rabbit why it was.
 Mr. Rabbit said it was quite a sad story, and perhaps not very interesting, as it had all happened so long ago, when he was quite small.
 "My folks lived then in the Heavy Thickets, over beyond the Wide Grasslands," he said; "it was a very nice place, with a good school,
 kept by a stiff-kneed rabbit named Whack--J. Hickory Whack--which seemed to fit him. I was the only child in our family that year, and I suppose I was spoiled. I remember my folks let me run and play a good deal,
 instead of making me study my lessons, so that Hickory Whack did not like me much, though he was afraid to be as severe as he was with most of the others, my folks being quite well off and I an only child. Of course, the other scholars didn't like that, and I don't blame them now,
 though I didn't care then whether they liked it or not. I didn't care for anything, except to go capering about the woods, gathering flowers and trying to make up poetry, when I should have been doing my examples.
 I didn't like school or J. Hickory Whack, and every morning I hated to start, until, one day, a new family moved into our neighborhood. They were named Bun, and one of them was a little girl named Bunty--Bunty Bun."`],[
 `When Mr. Rabbit got that far in his story he stopped a minute and sighed, and filled his pipe again, and took out his handkerchief, and said he guessed a little speck of ashes had got into his eye. Then he said:
 "The Buns lived close to us, and the children went the same way to school as I did. Bunty was little and fat, and was generally behind,
 and I stayed behind with her, after the first morning. She seemed a very well-behaved little Miss Rabbit, and was quite plump, as I say, and used to have plump little books, which I used to carry for her and think how nice it would be if I could always go on carrying them and helping Bunty Bun over the mud-holes and ditches."
 Mr. Rabbit got another speck of ashes in his eye, and had to wipe it several times and blow his nose hard. Then he said:
 "She wore a little red cape and a pretty linsey dress, and her ears were quite slim and silky, and used to stand straight up, except when she was sad over anything. Then they used to lop down quite flat; when I saw them that way it made me sad, too. But when she was pleased and happy,
 they set straight up and she seemed to laugh all over.
 "I forgot all about not liking school. I used to watch until I saw the Bun children coming, and then run out and get behind, with Bunty, and take her books, and wish there was a good deal farther to go. When it got to be spring and flowers began to bloom, I would gather every one I saw for Bunty Bun, and once I made up a poem for her. I remember it still. It said:
 "Oh, Bunty Bun,
 The spring's begun,
 The violet's are in bloom.
 Oh, Bunty Bun,
 I'll pick you one,
 All full of sweet perfume.
 "The sun is bright,
 Our hearts are light,
 And we will skip and run.
 Prick up your ears,
 And dry your tears,
 Dear bunny, Bunty Bun."
 Mr. Rabbit said he didn't suppose it was the best poetry, but that it had meant so much to him then that he couldn't judge it now, and,
 anyway, it was no matter any more. The other children used to tease them a good deal, Mr. Rabbit said, but that he and Bunty had not minded it so very much, only, of course, he wouldn't have had them see his poem for anything. The trouble began when Bunty Bun decided to have a flower-garden.`],[
 `"She used to see new flowers along the way to and from school that she wanted me to dig up for her so she could set them out in her garden. I liked to do it better than anything, too, only not _going_ to school,
 because the ground was pretty soft and sticky, and it made my hands so dirty, and Hickory Whack was particular about the children having clean hands. I used to hide the flower plants under the corner of the school-house every morning, and hurry in and wash my hands before school took up, and the others used to watch me and giggle, for they knew what all that dirt came from. Our school was just one room, and there were rows of nails by the door to hang our things on, and there was a bench with the washbasin and the water-pail on it, the basin and the pail side by side. It was a misfortune for me that they were put so close together that way. But never mind--it is a long time ago.
 "One morning in April when it was quite chilly Bunty Bun saw several pretty plants on the way to school that she wanted me to dig up for her,
 root and all, for her garden. I said it would be better to get them on the way home that night, but Bunty said some one might come along and take them and that she wouldn't lose those nice plants for anything. So I got down on my knees and dug and dug with my hands in the cold, sticky dirt, until I got the roots all up for her, and my hands were quite numb and a sight to look at. Then we hurried on to school, for it was getting late.
 "When we got to the door I pushed the flower plants under the edge of the house, and we went in, Bunty ahead of me. School had just taken up,
 and all the scholars were in their seats except us. Bunty Bun went over to the girls' side to hang up her things, and I stuck my hat on a nail on our side, and stepped as quick as I could to the bench where the water was, to wash my hands.
 "There was some water in the basin, and I was just about to dip my hands in when I looked over toward Bunty Bun and saw her little ears all lopped down flat, for the other little girl rabbits were giggling at her for coming in with me and being late. The boy rabbits were giggling at me, too, which I did not mind so much. But I forgot all about the basin,
 for a minute, looking at Bunty Bun's ears, and when I started to wash my hands I kept looking at Bunty, and in that way made an awful mistake;
 for just when the water was feeling so good to my poor chilled hands,
 and I was waving them about in it, all the time looking at Bunty's droopy ears, somebody suddenly called out, 'Oh, teacher, Jacky Rabbit's washing his hands in the water-pail! Jacky Rabbit's washing his hands in the water-pail, teacher!'
 "And sure enough, I was! Looking at Bunty Bun and pitying her, I had made a miss-dip, and everybody was looking at me; and J. Hickory Whack said, in the most awful voice, 'Jack Rabbit, you come here, at once!'"
 Mr. Rabbit said he could hardly get to Hickory Whack's desk, he was so weak in the knees, and when Mr. Whack had asked him what he had meant by such actions he had been almost too feeble to speak.
 "I couldn't think of a word," he said, "for, of course, the only thing I could say was that I had been looking at Bunty Bun's little droopy ears,
 and that would have made everybody laugh, and been much worse. Then the teacher said he didn't see how he was going to keep himself from whipping me soundly, he felt so much that way, and he said it in such an awful tone that all the others were pretty scared, too, and quite still,
 all of them but just one--one scholar on the girls' side, who giggled right out loud--and I know you will hardly believe it when I tell you that it was Bunty Bun! I was sure I knew her laugh, but I couldn't believe it and, scared as I was, I turned to look, and there she sat,
 looking really amused, her slim little ears sticking straight up as they always did when she enjoyed anything."
 Mr. Rabbit rose and walked across the room and back, and sat down again,
 quite excitedly.
 "Think of it, after all I had done for her! I saw at once that there would be no pleasure in carrying her books and helping her over the mud-puddles in the way I had planned. And just then Hickory Whack grabbed a stick and reached for me. But he didn't reach quite far enough, for I was always rather spry, and I was half-way to the door with one spring, and out of it and on the way home, the next. Of course he couldn't catch me, with his stiff leg, and he didn't try. When I got home I told my folks that I didn't feel well, and needed a change of scene. So they said I could visit some relatives in the Big Deep Woods--an old aunt and uncle, and I set out on the trip within less than five minutes, for I was tired of the Thickets. My aunt and uncle were so glad to see me that I stayed with them, and when they died they left me their property. So I've always stayed over this way, and live in it still. Sometimes I go over to the Heavy Thickets, and once I saw Bunty Bun. She is married, and shows her age. She used to be fat and pretty and silly. Now she is just fat and silly, though I don't suppose she can help those things. Still, I had a narrow escape, and I've never thought of doing garden work since then for anybody but myself and my good friends, like those of the Hollow Tree."`],

 /* Title: The Rhymer Author: Allan McAulay Chapter 1 */
 [`In the year of grace 1787, Mr. Graham of The Mains, a worthy gentleman and laird of the county of Perth, had a family of seven daughters.
 This, though hardly at that date amounting to a social crime, was an indiscretion in a man of few acres and modest income. Moreover, his partner in life was even now a blooming and a buxom dame, capable of adding further olive branches to the already over-umbrageous family tree. She had, indeed, but lately performed the somewhat procrastinated duty of adding an heir to the tale of the seven lasses of The Mains.
 This was as it should be—but it was quite enough.
 It was market day in the autumn of the year, and Mr. Graham, who farmed his own land, had attended the weekly market at the country town of C——.
 He was about to jog home in the dusk, when he was accosted by a neighbour and fellow-laird.
 ’Hey—Mains!’ called out this personage. ’Bide a bit, man! It is in my mind to do you and the mistress at The Mains a good turn.’ Mr. Graham drew rein.
 ’It is not I that will miss a chance of that,’ he observed, in good humour.
 ’Well, to be straight to the point,’ said his friend, ’I have a friend biding with me at this time, one Jimmy Cheape—you may have heard me speak of him, for he was a crony of our college days. He is a man of substance in the county of Fife—and he has a mind to be made acquainted with you and your lady.’
 ’Ay, ay!’ ejaculated Mr. Graham. ’A most laudable and polite wish,
 truly, and not to be gainsaid!’
 ’He is in search of a wife,’ said the friend, slily, with a dig in the ribs of the laird with the butt-end of his whip, ’and I bethought me that a presentation to a man with seven daughters was the very thing to be useful. So I promised it, and he jumped for it—as keen as a cock at a groset.’
 Mr. Graham pricked up his ears.
 ’That’s the wife’s business rather than mine,’ he observed, cautiously.
 ’Well! let the wife see him, but see him yourself first. Yonder he is.’
 The speaker pointed to a burly form, standing with its back to the friends. ’I will bring him forward;’ and he proceeded to be as good as his word.
 When Mr. Cheape, of the county of Fife, presented his countenance to his possible father-in-law of the future, he was found to be a gentleman of decidedly mature age, already grey, deeply pitted with the smallpox, and of no very alluring address. His salutation was gruff, and his eye shifty.
 ’To-morrow,’ he remarked, with rather alarming abruptness, immediately after the form of introduction had been gone through, ’I will wait upon Mrs. Graham at The Mains, at about eleven of the clock in the morning.’
 With that he stumped off, for he added to his other peculiarities that of being rather lame of one leg.`],[
 `’Ah! he means business, you see!’ said the intermediary, admiringly.
 The corners of Mr. Graham’s mouth, which had taken an upward inclination at the first salutation of his friend, now drooped considerably, as he gazed after his new acquaintance.
 ’He is somewhat well on in years,’ he remarked, dubiously, ’and there is not that about him that will take a lass’s fancy.’
 ’Tut!’ said his friend, ’there is well-nigh one thousand a year about him and his bonny bit place of Kincarley in the county of Fife; and he has fine store of plate and plenishing of linen—so he tells me—as well as the siller. And _that_ takes a lass’s fancy fast enough, let me tell you.’
 ’Well, maybe,’ said the laird, and he gave the reins a jog. ’Good-night to you, and you shall hear what betides.’
 Mr. Graham jogged home along the muddy roads towards The Mains in a meditative mood. The thought of his seven daughters often sat heavy on his mind. He could not portion them, and, with or without portions, it was difficult to imagine how they could marry or settle in a part of the country so remote, that society could hardly be said to exist—daughters,
 as they were, of a man who could not possibly afford to send them to share the gaieties of the capital, or even of the distant county town.
 Yet their marriage was a fixed idea with his wife, as he well knew—the only idea, indeed, for their future which it was natural and proper, at that day, for her to entertain. Alison, their eldest girl, was almost twenty, and at that age her mother had been already three years married and had a thriving nursery; two others, well arrived at woman’s estate,
 trod closely on her heels. Very well indeed could the laird imagine with what enthusiasm his partner would welcome the advent of a suitor,
 and a wealthy suitor, too. Yet he had vague doubts as to whether he should have placed this temptation within reach of the eager mother of seven daughters. Perhaps it would have been better to have declined the visit from Mr. Cheape once for all. For although this obscure country laird of old-time Scotland had a rough exterior, not differing greatly from that of a farmer or yeoman of the better class, and though he rode a horse that sometimes drew the plough, a clumsy figure in his brass-buttoned blue coat and miry buckskins, yet he was a gentleman at heart, and an honest man to boot. He had been far from admiring the exterior and address of Mr. Cheape of Kincarley, and compunction assailed him when he thought of his Alison, or Kate, or Maggie,
 subjected to the wooing of such a bear. However, it was their mother’s affair, he thought, with that comfortable shifting of responsibility on to feminine shoulders which man has so gracefully inherited from Adam.
 Besides, he looked forward to telling the news, being a bit of a humorist in his own way. So he whipped up the old horse into a heavy trot.`],[
 `The Mains lay low and sheltered in the heart of an uninteresting agricultural corner of the Perthshire lowlands. It was a low, rambling,
 old house, of no pretensions—little better, indeed, than a farm—with small windows in thick walls, and little low-ceilinged, ill-lighted rooms. There were some fine sycamores about it, the abode of an ancient rookery, and a grand lime tree grew in the field in front of the house—so very old that no one knew or could guess its age. To the east of The Mains lay its farm buildings, and beyond them again the old-fashioned tangled garden. Further, and around on all sides, were thick spruce woods, where the wild pigeons crooned in the summer, and there were always cones for the gathering. Through gaps in the woods,
 and from certain points of vantage on The Mains’s land, you could see the Highland hills. But to Alison and her little sisters these always seemed far, far away—as though in another country altogether.
 Lights in the deep-set windows welcomed the laird, and they were cheery in the damp murk of the autumn evening. When he was divested of his mud-stiffened riding gear, he stretched himself at ease before the crackling fire in his own sanctum, and his lady joined him. It was a long, low, dark room, lined with fusty books, which no one ever took from the shelves. The mantelpiece was of solid stone, washed a pale green, and—chiseled roughly—just below the shelf was a motto, rudely finished off with a clam-shell, the crest of the Grahams:—
 ’_In human life there’s nothing steadfast stands,_ _Youth, Glorie, Riches fade. Death’s sure at hand._’
 So it said. But neither the laird nor the lady of The Mains had any air of paying attention to this warning of a somewhat despondent progenitor.
 The mistress of the house was a handsome woman still, in spite of household and maternal cares. Above the middle height, and of comely figure, she had hair still raven black, a glowing colour in her soft unwithered cheek, and the light of a strong and unimpaired vitality in her fine, though rather hard, black eye. She had the complete empire over her husband, which such a woman will ever have over men—a woman,
 healthy, fresh, strong-willed, though not moulded, perhaps, in the most refined of nature’s moulds. He had married her in his youth—the daughter of a small Glasgow lawyer, hardly, perhaps, his equal from a social point of view. But this was a failing soon overlooked in the blooming, hearty, managing bride, who brought fresh blood to mingle with the rather attenuated strain of a genteel Scottish family, which boasted more lineage than looks.
 The laird stretched himself to the genial warmth, and prepared to enjoy the communication of his bit of news.
 ’A gentleman is to visit us here at The Mains to-morrow in the morning,
 wife,’ he began, casually.`],[
 `’Oh, ay,’ said Mrs. Graham, in the tone of one who expects no pleasant surprises. ’It’ll be Cultobanocher or Drumore, likely, to speir about the grey mare and her foal.’
 ’Not at all,’ said the laird, ’but a stranger this time—one Cheape of Kincarley, in the county of Fife, at this time abiding with Drumore.’
 ’And what will he be wanting with us?’ inquired the mistress of The Mains.
 ’A wife, it would seem,’ said the laird, in a carefully-suppressed tone of voice, but a twinkle in his eye.
 ’Tut, laird!’ said the lady, crossly, ’you’re joking, but none of your jokes for me!’ She indeed believed the news too good to be true, and was wroth with the laird for tantalising her on so tender a subject.
 ’I am not joking—not I,’ protested the husband and father. ’’Tis the living truth, as I sit here. This fellow will be over here to-morrow at noon to see if he cannot choose a wife among our seven lasses.’
 Then followed, in answer to a rain of questions from the excited lady, a full and particular account of Mr. Cheape, his means and estate—all,
 indeed, that the laird could tell. Mrs. Graham’s face was flushed, her eyes sparkling; the corners of her full, firm mouth twitched with eagerness. Before the conversation was half over, she had the wedding settled in her mind, with already a side-thought for the bride’s dress,
 and such scanty plenishing as could be spared from The Mains.
 ’And to think that I was putting poor Ally down for an old maid!’ she exclaimed, rapturously. ’The girl with never a man after her yet, and then to have this rich husband flung at her head! She was born with a silver spoon in her mouth, after all—poor Ally!’
 ’Bide a wee!’ said the laird, cautiously. ’Wait till you see the man,
 my woman! A grey beard, even like myself, and speckled like a puddock wi’ the cow-pox. I doubt the girl will get a scunner when she sees him.’
 But his partner pounced upon his doubts with righteous anger.
 ’Laird,’ she said, ’if I see you putting the like o’ that into Ally’s head, I’ll be at the end of my patience. Setting the lass against her meat that gait—such foolery!’
 ’Lasses think of love—’ began the laird.
 ’Love, indeed!’ almost screamed the lady; ’and what right has _she_ to think of love, and her almost twenty, and never a jo to her name yet, or a man’s kiss but her father’s on the cheek o’ her? When _I_ was her age, well knew I what love was; but _she_—let her thank her stars she’s got this chance, and needna pine a spinster all her days!’
 ’Well, well,’ said the laird, uncomfortably, ’manage it your own way.
 I’ll keep my fingers out of the pie. And sort _you_ Mr. Cheape of Kincarley when he comes to-morrow, for I’ll ha’ none of him!’
 His lady, finding he would respond on the subject no longer, bustled off to her daughter.`]
